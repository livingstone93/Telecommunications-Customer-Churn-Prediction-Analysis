# Telecommunications-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis
The repository presents a machine learning classification project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue using a companyâ€™s services. For telecom to companies to retain customers and main profit making margin, understanding and predicting of churn is crucial.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset provided by a telecom company, we aim to uncover patterns, relationships, and key factors influencing churn. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and interpretation.
Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution, relationships, and characteristics of the variables.
Missing Value Handling: Address missing values in the dataset using appropriate imputation or removal techniques.
Feature Engineering: Transform and create new features to enhance the predictive power of the models.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Model Interpretation: Interpret the models to understand the factors driving customer churn and their relative importance.
